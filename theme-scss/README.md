# Sass Boilerplate
Forked from the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture), with use alongside stencil components the only pieces we're currently using are the base and abstract folders.

## Use with Node-sass

When using `node-sass` - in order to build that boilerplate, one needs to:

- install `node-sass` if not yet installed:

```bash
npm install -g node-sass
```

- run build command from command line:

```bash
node-sass stylesheets/main.scss dist/main.css
```
